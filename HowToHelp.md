# Introduction #

BridJ is an ambitious project that aims at becoming the ultimate free interop library for Java (free as in freedom and beer : [BSD-licensed](CreditsAndLicense.md)).

BridJ and JNAerator are mainly developed by a [single individual](http://ochafik.com) but they also have a handful of occasional committers and received [many contributions](CreditsAndLicense.md) in the form of bug reports and suggestions.

Even if you're not a programmer you're welcome to contribute to these projects, and we'll be happy to help you with your contribution.

This page details some ways you can help us.

If any item rings a bell,
[let's discuss it](http://groups.google.fr/group/nativelibs4java).

# New projects #

See [GoogleSummerOfCode](GoogleSummerOfCode.md) for details on some ambitious sub-project that will likely not see the light of day without your help.

# Bug Fixes and Enhancements #

There are [Many](Issues.md), just waiting for you.

# Graphics #

BridJ has no icon, JNAerator neither.

Feel like changing that ?

# Money or Hardware donations #

BridJ is developped, debugged and built on different CPU architectures and different operating systems (Windows 32/64, Linux x86/x64, MacOS x86/x64/ppc).

What refrains me from porting it to Solaris (sparcv8, sparcv9) or FreeBSD is I don't have the appropriate hardware and / or system administration knowledge. If you do, please help by sending me hardware and / or advice.

In the case of hardware lending, I can guarantee return of the hardware if we negociate the associated costs.
