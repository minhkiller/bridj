Contributing to BridJ

BridJ now has [a few occasional contributors](CreditsAndLicense.md) as well as [many bug reporters](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/issues).

Any further help will be highly welcome !

You can help in many ways :
  * report bugs
  * suggest / write documentation
  * investigate [open bugs](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/issues)
  * submit patches / pull requests for fixes or new features
  * help users on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/nativelibs4java) or on StackOverflow

If you wish to contribute code, you'll want to have a look at the [Build](Build.md) page.

In any case if you don't know where to start, please ask on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/nativelibs4java).
